Here is **Heng Cao (操亨)**.

I am a postdoctoral fellow majoring in **CO<sub>2</sub> photoreduction** at University of Science and Technology of China. Currently, I am working as a postdoctor in the **National Synchrontron Radiation Lab** (NSRL), advised by [Prof. Jun Bao](http://team.ustc.edu.cn/Baogroup/zh_CN/) and cooperate with [Prof. Yang Pan](https://www.x-mol.com/groups/Pan_Yang).

## Academic Background

- **Sep 2014 - June 2018:** China University of Geoscience (Major in Applied Chemistry, Bachelor)
- **Sep 2018 - May 2023:** University of Science and Technology of China (Major in Nuclear Science and Technology, PhD)


## Research Interests

- CO<sub>2</sub> photoreduction
- Synchrontron Radiation based Charaterizations
- CH<sub>4</sub> photooxidation

My current research focuses on photocatalytic conversion of warm house gas. My interests are on the **design of high performance materials** and its applications in **CO<sub>2</sub> photoreduction and CH<sub>4</sub> photooxidation**. Besides, the corresponding mechanism are investigated by advanced charaterizations, especially Synchrontron Radiation based and Free Electron Laser based techonologies.
